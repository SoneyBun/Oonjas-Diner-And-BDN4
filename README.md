My teacher allowed us to use Roblox to create a game as part of our science project which allowed us to creatively present our understanding of DNA. I chose to make a virtual 3D DNA structure using the Roblox Studio platform rather than building a physical model like most students do. I made a double helix structure for the game that has labeled components such as base pairs nitrogenous bases and the sugar-phosphate backbone. Every component was color-coded for simple identification for instance cytosine and guanine and adenine and thymine were paired in particular colors.

Although the projects biology content was crucial it only accounted for a small percentage of the games overall development process. Create a three-dimensional (3D) model of a DNA molecule with labeled nucleotides and other crucial elements like base pairs and the sugar-phosphate backbone.

For those wondering what we've scored on the project,
